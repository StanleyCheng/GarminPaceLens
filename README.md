# GarminPaceLens

This project fetches Garmin Connect activities, cleans run/walk/hike records,
writes an Excel export, and builds a static interactive Plotly training dashboard.

- Repository: [StanleyCheng/GarminPaceLens](https://github.com/StanleyCheng/GarminPaceLens)
- Production app: [GarminPaceLens](https://garminpacelens.vercel.app)
- Additional static deployments: [Netlify](https://mygarmin.netlify.app) and
  [GitHub Pages](https://stanleycheng.github.io/GarminPaceLens/viz/)

The Vercel dashboard supports separate user accounts and on-demand imports of
each user's complete Garmin activity history. Supabase Auth handles app
passwords; Supabase stores per-user dashboard data and encrypted Garmin
connections. See [Vercel and Supabase setup](docs/vercel-setup.md) for the SQL
schema and four server environment variables. Keep `.env` local and enter
Vercel variables individually.

The existing Supabase resource is connected to the `garminpacelens`
Vercel project on the Free plan in Singapore. The project rename preserves
the database and integration. The production schema and encryption key are
configured. See the setup guide when initializing another environment.

Create an account with an app username/password and Garmin email/password.
Later sign-ins need only the app username/password. Account settings let
users update their Garmin connection or import their own verified session
if Garmin requires MFA. The top-right refresh icon loads all Garmin records,
and a flashing green dot shows the active import. The dashboard changes only
after the full import succeeds; its timestamp records that successful sync.

## One-time setup

Requirements: Python 3.14 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
uv sync --dev
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Garmin Connect login. The file is ignored by Git.

The first successful login stores refreshable authentication tokens in
`~/.garminconnect/garmin_tokens.json`. Later refreshes reuse those tokens, so
they do not repeatedly submit your password to Garmin. Set `GARMINTOKENS` in
`.env` only if you want a different private location.

If login fails with `Failed to retrieve social profile`, run `uv sync --dev`
to install the pinned Garmin client, then retry the fetch command once.
The updated client validates login tokens against Garmin's API and automatically
reauthenticates when cached tokens are rejected
([upstream authentication notes](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect#authentication)).
Complete any MFA prompt in your terminal.

## Refresh to the latest Garmin data

```sh
uv run python get-garmin.py --max-activities 10000
```

If Garmin reports `429`, `CAPTCHA_REQUIRED`, or HTTP `403`, stop retrying.
Sign in at [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) in a browser and
complete any challenge, wait for Garmin's login cooldown, then run the command
once. After that successful run, the saved token is reused automatically. If
Garmin asks for MFA during the command, enter the code at the terminal prompt.

The local command fetches activities newest-first and stops when it reaches
the requested limit or Garmin returns no more records. The Vercel refresh
has no such count limit and continues until Garmin returns an empty page.
The local command writes:

- `garmin_activities_formatted.xlsx` — cleaned activity rows.
- `viz/data/garmin_activities.json` — dashboard data and monthly aggregates.

The terminal also reports how many activities were dropped by each cleaning
rule. Increase `--max-activities` if the Garmin account contains more than
10,000 activities.

## Display the interactive chart

In browsers that allow local module scripts, you can open `viz/index.html`
directly and choose the `viz/data/garmin_activities.json` export when prompted.
The file is read in your browser and is not uploaded. To load the export
automatically, or if your browser blocks local scripts, serve `viz/` over HTTP:

```sh
uv run python -m http.server 8000 --directory viz
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The page supports year,
month, activity type, and distance filters. Swipe the icon rail (or use its
arrow buttons and keyboard) to switch between weekly volume, comparable pace,
year comparisons, pace versus heart rate, an activity calendar, long-run
progression, VO₂ max estimates, pace distribution, climbing, and best recorded
whole activities near a chosen distance. The monthly table follows the filters.
Included activities use a whole-activity pace of 3:00–20:00 per km; missing or
implausible heart rate leaves the activity available for non-HR views.
For newer data locally, run `get-garmin.py` again and choose the refreshed
export (or reload the HTTP preview). On Vercel, use
the top-right refresh icon, beside the last successful data-update time.

For a non-interactive image from the Excel file:

```sh
uv run python run-analysis.py garmin_activities_formatted.xlsx --chart-type line --output chart.png
```

## Privacy

The generated JSON contains activity dates, distances, pace, and heart-rate
data. It is ignored by Git and excluded from Vercel uploads. In the hosted
app, authenticated API requests load each user's private Supabase snapshot.
Garmin credentials must never be placed in `viz/` or committed. Neither
`.env` nor reusable Garmin tokens belong in Git or deployment uploads.

## Checks

```sh
uv run python -m pytest
node --check viz/app.js
node --test tests/test_insights.mjs
```
